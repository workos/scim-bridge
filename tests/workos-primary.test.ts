/**
 * `workos-primary`, rung 3 of the ladder: WorkOS answers the IdP and the proxy
 * still writes the native app directly. Both legs run at once and the IdP is answered
 * only once both have finished.
 *
 * What these tests hold in place, in order of how expensive the mistake would be:
 *
 *   1. The IdP is never told a write succeeded when one side rejected it.
 *   2. A write WorkOS kept and native refused is recorded durably, whatever the
 *      directory's log settings say.
 *   3. A retry converges rather than duplicating — the property that makes
 *      "fail the request" a safe policy here at all.
 *   4. The legs overlap, so the mode costs max(native, workos) and not the sum.
 *   5. Native is still current at every rung, in both directions, with no
 *      reconcile and no backfill in between.
