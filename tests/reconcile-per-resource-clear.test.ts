/**
 * The defect these pin: the reconcile's per-resource clear is not bound to the
 * watermark the sweep is. `markDivergencesForSweep` stamps the ledger at reconcile start so the
 * end-of-run sweep can only retire rows that predate the snapshot, but the clear
 * that runs after each successful replay PUT deletes by (directory, type, key)
 * alone — no stamp, no `method != 'DELETE'`. A divergence recorded by live
 * workos-primary traffic AFTER its resource's snapshot page was read describes a
 * newer WorkOS write the replay never pushed (the replay carries snapshot-time
 * state), yet the replay's own PUT erases it, and the stamped sweep never sees the
 * row. The operator's cutover gate turns green over a real gap.
 *
 * This is the mirrored ordering of the sweep's ABA scenario: there the live failure
 * landed after the replay touched the key (and was erased by the sweep); here it
 * lands before, and is erased by the per-resource clear.
 *
 * Both divergences are recorded by driving the real proxy HTTP handler with the
 * IdP's proxy token — the interface the IdP uses — not by calling the recorder.
