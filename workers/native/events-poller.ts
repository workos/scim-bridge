/**
 * The Events API polling transport: the ordered alternative to webhooks.
 *
 * WorkOS webhooks carry no ordering guarantee, and the listener's timestamp
 * ledger can only order events whose `created_at` differ — a stale
 * `dsync.user.deleted` delivered 31s late once destroyed state a newer event
 * had established. `GET /events` returns the same envelopes **in order** behind
 * a cursor, so applying them in returned order needs no timestamps at all.
 *
 * Every event still flows through `processDsyncEvent` — the same
 * handle-vs-ignore instruction, replay guards, dedup and event log as a webhook
 * delivery — so running both transports at once only costs "skipped duplicate"
 * rows, never a double apply.
 *
 * The API key that authenticates this endpoint is environment-wide — a broader
 * credential than anything else the listener holds — which is why it comes
 * from the environment (WORKOS_API_KEY) first. The demo panel may store one
 * instead (encrypted at rest — see events-transport.ts), and the env var
 * always wins over the stored copy.
