 * else: native never stopped being written, so there is nothing to reconcile.
 *
 * The two legs run CONCURRENTLY and the IdP is answered only once both have

 *
 *   both succeed        → WorkOS's response, in native-id space
 *   either one fails    → the IdP is told the request failed
 *
 * It is not atomic and cannot be — there is no transaction across two HTTP

 * asked to keep and it cannot be reliably undone. What the design buys instead is
 * that the IdP is told the truth, and that the side allowed to drift is WorkOS
 * rather than native: for a mode whose whole promise is "native is current", that
 * is the correct side. The divergence is recorded in `native_write_failures` (not
 * `proxy_log`, which a directory has to opt into) and surfaced in the panel, where
 * "Reconcile from WorkOS" is the repair.
 *
 * Failing back to the IdP is safe here specifically because of the migrated-id
 * contract: a retry converges instead of duplicating. Ids are shared rather than
 * minted per attempt, creates run PUT → 404 → POST-with-header, and a 409 is
 * recovered by lookup on both sides. In a generic dual-write, "fail and let them
 * retry" would manufacture duplicates. Do not weaken that property.

/**
 * A create on `workos-primary`.
 *
 * Split from the other verbs because a create is the one request whose id is not
 * in the path, and full concurrency needs an id both sides can arrive at
 * independently:
 *
 *   POST with an `externalId` → concurrent. WorkOS's row is minted from the
 *     `externalId`, exactly as the workos-only create leg does; native mints its
 *     own id and reports it. The two can differ, and the `id_mappings` row
 *     (`fallback-post`) is what translates WorkOS's answer back into the id space
 *     the IdP saw on rungs 1–2.
 *   POST without one → native-first, adopting native's id, exactly as dual-write
 *     does. Two concurrent sides would each mint an id the other never sees, and
 *     the resource would exist twice under two unrelated ids — the id divergence
 *     the whole id-mapping design exists to prevent. A create is also the one
 *     request the IdP has not yet been told an id for, so serializing it costs a
 *     round trip on a request that happens once per resource.
 *
 * The `externalId` is only minted into the WorkOS row's id where this directory
 * has the native namespace to itself, exactly as the workos-only create leg does.
 * The mapping this create writes is keyed on native's own echoed id, so it cannot
 * claim a row the directory did not create — but the WorkOS row id is itself a
 * native address later on: an unmapped WorkOS row is what a reconcile replays at
 * its raw id, and a native leg that fails leaves exactly such a row.
 * In a shared namespace the id is minted at random instead, so the row a failed
 * create leaves behind names nothing in the native app. (The other unscoped id in
 * this path — a native 409 resolved from an unscoped listing — is guarded in
 * `nativeCreate`.)
