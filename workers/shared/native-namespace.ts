/**
 * One directory per native SCIM namespace, enforced where a directory is
 * configured rather than where it is used.
 *
 * Two directories pointed at one native endpoint share a single id space. The
 * bridge cannot verify that the customer's SCIM service partitions its rows by
 * the bearer token that authenticated a call, so a native id it reads for one
 * directory may name a row belonging to another — which is how six separate
 * cross-tenant write paths were found in this codebase, each after the previous
 * one was fixed (#32, #40, #49, #51, #57, #67).
 *
 * Those six guards stay. This module makes them unreachable: a constraint
 * checked when a directory is saved cannot be wrong per-request. If one of them
 * ever fires in production, the constraint has leaked.
 *
 * One relaxation, opt-in and per-directory: a SCIM service that serves every
 * tenant from one flat URL and decides the tenant from the bearer token can be
 * attested as such (`native_token_partitioned`) on each directory that fronts
 * it. When every directory on one canonical URL is attested and each presents
 * its own non-empty token, the namespace identity becomes (URL, token) and the
 * conflict lifts — see `tokenPartitionSplits`. That converts a verifiable
 * guarantee into an operator's promise, which is why anything short of full
 * opt-in keeps the refusal, and why the runtime guards stay live for every
 * unattested configuration.
 *
 * There is deliberately no UNIQUE index behind this. The column stores the URL
 * the operator typed, verbatim, so a unique index would let a trailing slash
 * through; and a migration that added one would refuse to apply against a
 * database that already violates the rule — locking an operator out of the
 * panel that is the only place they can repair it. Pre-existing violations are
 * reported instead (`duplicateNativeNamespaces`), never fatal.
 */
