/**
 * The Worker that fronts the SCIM bridge container on Cloudflare.
 *
 * Cloudflare runs a container by attaching it to a Durable Object: the Worker
 * receives the request, the DO owns the container, and `getContainer(...).fetch()`
 * forwards to it. Everything the container needs arrives as environment variables
 * set in the constructor below.
 *
 * The credential split is the important part, and it is not a convention we
 * invented — it is Cloudflare's:
 *
 *   - **Secrets** (`wrangler secret put NAME`) are encrypted at rest, are not shown
 *     in the dashboard, and are not in this file or any file you commit.
 *   - **Vars** (`vars` in wrangler.jsonc) are plaintext configuration, visible in the
 *     dashboard. Fine for URLs; wrong for anything that authenticates.
 *
 * A secret arrives on `env` as an ordinary string, which is why it can be copied
 * into `envVars` here. (Verified rather than assumed: a Worker secret set locally
 * through `.dev.vars` reaches `process.env` inside the container.) An account-level
 * **Secrets Store binding** could *not* be used this way — those are read with an
 * async `get()`, and this is a constructor. Per-Worker secrets are also the better
 * fit: these values belong to one deployment rather than being shared across Workers.
 *
 * `DIRECTORIES_JSON` is a secret and not a var, which is easy to get wrong because it
 * reads like configuration. It carries each directory's `proxy_token` — the bearer
 * token the IdP presents — and those are credentials. Putting it in `vars` would
 * publish every directory's SCIM token to anyone who can read the config or open the
 * dashboard.
